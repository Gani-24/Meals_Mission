# Meals Mission

This open innovation
project aims to develop a mobile application using Flutter that connects individuals or small businesses with excess food to local community organizations, such as homeless shelters or food banks, in need of donations. By providing a streamlined platform for food donation, the app can help reduce food
waste and promote food security in local communities. Through the app, donors can easily register and provide information about the type and quantity of food they have available for donation, while community organizations can search for available donations based on their location and the type of food required.

## What I could have done if more time was there
1. Live map location tracking: With more time, I could have added live map location tracking for NGOs to track the food from the volunteers in real-time. This feature would have provided a more accurate and efficient system for tracking food donations.

2. Improved UI: With more time, I could have improved the UI by adding more features, such as profile editing and additional options for users to customize their experience. This would have made the app more user-friendly and attractive to potential users.

3. Certificates for Volunteers: With more time, I could have implemented a feature to give certificates to volunteers for their donations. This would have provided a sense of achievement and recognition for the volunteers and encouraged more people to donate their excess food.

4. Leaderboard for most donations: With more time, I could have added a leaderboard to the app to showcase the top volunteers who made the most donations. This would have created a competitive and motivational environment for volunteers to make more donations and help reduce food waste.

5. Integration with other services: With more time, I could have integrated the app with other services to improve its functionality. For example, integrating with weather services to warn volunteers about potential weather issues or integrating with local waste management companies to help them dispose of excess food in an environmentally friendly way.
